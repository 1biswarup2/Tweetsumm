# TweetSumm
A dataset focused on summarization of dialogs, which represents the rich domain of Twitter customer care conversations 

Tweetsumm comprises of 1,100 dialogs reconstructed from Tweets that appear in the [Kaggle Customer Support On Twitter](www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter) dataset each accompanied by 3 extractive and 3 abstractive summaries generated by human annotators.

## TweetSumm format

TweetSumm is released with a partition in Train/Test/Valid files.
Each file is in [JSON Lines format](https://jsonlines.org/).

A TweetSum entry (line) has a the following format:
- **conversation_id** : a unique identifier of the dialog
- **tweet_ids_sentence_offset** : a list of 
    -  **tweet_id** : corresponding to Tweeter Id in [Kaggle Customer Support On Twitter](www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter) dataset
    -  **sentence offsets** : the offset of the sentences splitting we used.
- **annotations** : a list of summaries generated by the human annotators - each entry contains :
    - **extractive** : a list of sentences selected from the initial dialog. The sentences are in the format **tweet_id**, **sentence offsets**
    - **abstractive** : a list of one or two sentences.


## TweetSumm processing

The script `tweet_summ_processor` allows to transform the TweetSumm entries to readable strings for further processing.

The `TweetSumProcessor` class requires one parameter : the path to the `twcs file` of [Kaggle Customer Support On Twitter](www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter). This file can be download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter/download).

The `TweetSumProcessor` has one method : `get_dialog_with_summaries` which gets a list of TweetSumm entries (lines in the TweetSumm files) and returns a list of corresponding `DialogWithSummaries` objects. These objects allow to access to the readable conversation associated with their readable human generated summaries.

**Code sample:**
```
    processor = TweetSumProcessor(TWCS_FILE_PATH)
    with open(TWEET_SUMM_FILE_PATH) as f:
        dialog_with_summaries = processor.get_dialog_with_summaries(f.readlines())
        for dialog_with_summary in dialog_with_summaries:
            ....
```
